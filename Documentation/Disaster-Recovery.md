# My Disaster Recovery Plan for the AI Content Rewriter Plugin

## 1. Introduction  
As the developer of the **AI Content Rewriter Plugin**, I have created this **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)** to ensure that if anything goes wrong—whether it’s a server failure, a security breach, or a software issue—I can quickly restore the system and minimise downtime. This plan outlines the steps I will take to recover the application and keep everything running smoothly.

## 2. My Objectives  
- Ensure that the AI Content Rewriter Plugin remains operational even in the event of a failure.  
- Minimise downtime and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.  
- Protect sensitive data, including API keys and user settings.  
- Maintain the integrity of the infrastructure and prevent future issues.  

## 3. Potential Risks  
I have identified several risks that could impact the plugin:  
- **Server Failure** – If the cloud infrastructure goes down, the plugin won’t function.  
- **Data Corruption** – Plugin settings or rewritten content could be lost due to an update failure.  
- **Security Threats** – If the system is compromised, unauthorised users could access sensitive data.  
- **Human Error** – Accidental deletions or misconfigurations could cause problems.  

## 4. My Backup Strategy  
### 4.1 What I Backup and How Often  
- **Daily backups** of the WordPress database and plugin files.  
- **Weekly full server snapshots** stored securely in AWS S3.  

### 4.2 Where My Backups Are Stored  
- **Primary Backup Location**: AWS S3 (encrypted).  
- **Secondary Backup Location**: A secure internal backup server.  
- **Retention Policy**:  
  - Daily backups are kept for 30 days.  
  - Weekly snapshots are retained for 90 days.  

## 5. How I Recover from a Disaster  
### 5.1 Diagnosing the Problem  
Whenever an issue arises, I will:  
1. Check **AWS CloudWatch logs** for infrastructure issues.  
2. Review **WordPress error logs** to see if the plugin is malfunctioning.  
3. Identify whether the issue is a **configuration error, system failure, or security breach**.  

### 5.2 The Recovery Process  
#### If the Plugin Fails (Configuration Errors, API Issues)  
1. I will restore the **most recent plugin backup** using the WordPress admin panel.  
2. I’ll verify that **API keys** and **tone of voice settings** are correctly configured.  
3. I’ll test the plugin to confirm everything is back to normal before relaunching it.  

#### If the Server Goes Down  
1. I will **redeploy the cloud infrastructure** using my AWS CloudFormation template.  
2. I will **restore the latest server snapshot** from AWS S3.  
3. I’ll ensure the **WordPress instance, database, and plugin files** are properly reconfigured.  
4. Once the system is restored, I will test functionality before reopening access.  

#### If a Security Breach Occurs  
1. I will **immediately revoke all API keys** and issue new ones.  
2. I’ll check the **server access logs** for any suspicious activity.  
3. I will run **malware scans using chkrootkit** and isolate affected components.  
4. Passwords will be reset, and **two-factor authentication (2FA)** will be enforced for all admin accounts.  
5. After securing the system, I will conduct a **thorough security audit**.  

## 6. Preventing Future Issues  
To avoid recurring problems, I will:  
- Use **AWS WAF rules** to protect against attacks.  
- Keep **all software, including WordPress, PHP, and server components, up to date**.  
- Enforce **strict access control** to limit administrative privileges.  
- Run **quarterly disaster recovery tests** to ensure my backups and procedures are effective.  

## 7. Communication Plan  
If a major issue occurs, I will:  
- Document the incident in **Jira** for tracking and future improvements.  
- Provide **real-time updates via Slack or email** to relevant stakeholders.  
- Notify the **IT support team** and escalate to security specialists if needed.  

## 8. Reviewing and Testing My Plan  
- Every **three months**, I will **test this disaster recovery plan** by simulating failures.  
- **Once a year**, I will update this plan to reflect changes in infrastructure, security policies, or business requirements.  

## 9. Conclusion  
By having this plan in place, I am confident that I can recover quickly from any disaster and maintain a stable and secure AI Content Rewriter Plugin. Regular testing, backups, and security measures will ensure that my system remains resilient and effective.
